**Project Details: - **

The project aims to analyze and visualize the distribution and trends of tickets issued throughout 2020. By employing pivot tables and charts, the project provides a clear understanding of the daily issuance of tickets and the breakdown of tickets by provision and infraction. This analysis can help identify patterns, peak periods of ticket issuance, and common infractions, assisting in strategic planning and enforcement improvements.

**Pivot Table 1: Daily Tickets Analysis**

Objective: To summarize and visualize the total number of tickets issued each day throughout the year.
Data Fields Used:
Row: Infraction Code
Values: Count of total ticket issued
Visualization: Pie Chart.
The pie chart represents the share of tickets issued on a daily basis, making it easier to identify days with unusually high or low ticket volumes. While pie charts are generally more effective for showing a breakdown of a few categories, for daily analysis over a year, a line chart might provide clearer insights over time.


**Pivot Table 2: Tickets by Provision and Infraction**

Objective: To analyze the distribution of tickets issued, categorized by different provisions and infractions.
Data Fields Used:
Rows: Infraction Description
Columns: Province
Values: Sum of fine amount
Visualization: Column-Line Graph.
This graph combines a column chart, which could represent the count of tickets per provision, with a line graph, possibly overlaying a trend or comparing multiple provisions over time. This dual approach allows for a detailed analysis of the data, highlighting both the distribution of infractions within provisions and the temporal trends or comparisons across different categories.
